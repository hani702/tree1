you might have dozens of choices. But if you're living in a smaller
town, there's still an opportunity to save money by taking preventative
measures. For instance, regular tree maintenance can prevent costly
repairs and replacements.<br />

<br />
<br />
</span>There are many different types of tree services and the costs
can vary greatly. Small trees will cost around $500 to $600 to remove,
while large trees will cost between $800 and $1,700. For trees over 80
feet tall, you will likely pay around $1,500 to $3,000. Aside from the
cost of the tree itself, you will also need to pay for stump removal
and clean-up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Poplar trees, for example, can grow to 90 to 115 feet and have
extensive roots. A poplar tree removal can cost around $1500 to $2,000.
Some trees may be diseased, making them a health hazard and an
increased risk for injury. If you are unsure about the safety of your
tree, hire a tree service to inspect it before it is cut down.&nbsp; <a href="https://tree-service-guys.com/tree-removal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">https://tree-service-guys.com/tree-removal</span></a><br />
